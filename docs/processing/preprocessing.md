## Executing *fMRIPrep*
Because *fMRIPrep* creates a single anatomical reference for all sessions, we generate such reference first by setting the `--anat-only` flag.
If that *fMRIPrep* execution finishes successfully, the anatomical processing outcomes will be stored in the output folder.
We will then run one *fMRIPrep* process for each dataset's session, which is the recommended way for datasets with a large number of sessions (e.g., more than 
six sessions).
We avert that session-wise *fMRIPrep*'s processes run into race conditions by pre-computing the anatomical reference.

- [ ] Submit the anatomical workflow:
    ``` bash title="Launch each session through fMRIPrep in parallel"
    cd code/fmriprep
    bash ss-fmriprep-anatonly.sh
    ```

    ??? abstract "The sbatch file to run *fMRIPrep* with `--anat-only`"

        ``` bash
{% filter indent(width=8) %}
{% include 'code/fmriprep/ss-fmriprep-anatonly.sh' %}
{% endfilter %}
        ```

- [ ] Once the anatomical workflow ran successfully, submit a *job array* with one scanning session each with the `--bids-filter-file` argument selecting the
    corresponding session, and point the `--fs-subjects-dir` argument to the folder where *FreeSurfer* results were stored.
    ``` bash title="Launch each session through fMRIPrep in parallel"
    cd code/fmriprep
    bash ss-fmriprep.sh
    ```

    ??? abstract "The sbatch file to run *fMRIPrep* session-wise"

        ``` bash
{% filter indent(width=8) %}
{% include 'code/fmriprep/ss-fmriprep.sh' %}
{% endfilter %}
        ```
??? warning "Not all *fMRIPrep* derivatives were generated"

    If some derivatives are missing, it is a sign that *fMRIPrep* encountered an error.
    
    - [ ] Check the "Errors" section of the visual report.
    - [ ] Check the `log/` folder corresponding to the *fMRIPrep* run, carefully ensuring no errors were missed out on the reports.
    - [ ] Search for associated keywords in the [issues on *fMRIPrep*'s GitHub repository](https://github.com/nipreps/fmriprep/issues) if the solution remains 
        unclear after the first assessment; it is likely someone else experienced the same problem before you and reported it.
        The solution might be documented in the issue.
        Don't forget to check closed issues!
    - [ ] Search for the issue on [NeuroStars](https://neurostars.org/), if the solution remains unclear.
    - [ ] If the solution remains elusive, open an issue in *fMRIPrep*'s GitHub repository to report the problem.
        Your description of the problem needs to be as complete and detailed as possible to help the maintainers identify the problem efficiently.
    - [ ] Re-run *fMRIPrep* on that particular subject and session after implementing a solution.

## Visualizing *fMRIPrep*'s individual reports

Following our protocols<sup>[1]</sup>, the quality of unprocessed images MUST be assessed [before](../data-management/mriqc.md#visualizing-mriqcs-individual-reports) and after preprocessing to verify it did not go awry.

### Anatomical preprocessing assessment

- [ ] Open the *fMRIPrep* anatomical report on a current Web Browser (*Google Chrome* is preferred).
- [ ] Assess the "Summary" section and apply the [QA/QC criteria](qaqc-criteria-preprocessed.md#summary).
- [ ] Assess the "Anatomical conformation" section and apply the [QA/QC criteria](qaqc-criteria-preprocessed.md#anatomical-conformation).
- [ ] Assess the mosaic showing the calculated brain mask and brain tissue segmentation, and apply the [QA/QC criteria](qaqc-criteria-preprocessed.md#brain-mask-and-brain-tissue-segmentation-of-the-t1w).
- [ ] Visualize the spatial normalization flickering mosaic, and apply the [QA/QC criteria](qaqc-criteria-preprocessed.md#spatial-normalization-of-the-anatomical-t1w-reference).
    Flickering between the subject and the template space is active while hovering your mouse on the mosaic area.
- [ ] Assess the surface reconstruction mosaic, and apply the [QA/QC criteria](qaqc-criteria-preprocessed.md#surface-reconstruction).
- [ ] Visualize the first section entitled `Summary` and apply the [QA/QC criteria](qaqc-criteria-preprocessed.md#summary).

    !!! warning "Running through the visual report does not have to be executed in a fixed order"

        While we describe the run through the report as linear, often inspecting other reportlets can help make a decision about the exclusion criteria related 
        to the reportlet at hand. 
        As such, we encourage you to jump back and forth between visualizations as much as needed.

### Assessment of fMRI Preprocessing

- [ ] Open each *fMRIPrep* functional report on a current Web Browser (*Google Chrome* is preferred).

#### QCT
!!! note "We are checking QCT fMRI first and in principle not excluding QCT scans"
    Except if the image is [extremely distorted](qaqc-criteria.md#task-fmri-exclusion-criteria), we are not excluding QCT scans because we will leverage those  
    images to evaluate the quality of fMRI scans and derived constructs throughout the whole analysis pipeline. We are however going through the *MRIQC* reports 
    to train our eye, anticipate issues that might be affecting RSfMRI and flag the corresponding sessions.

- [ ] Go through the report section of the QCT
    - [ ] Scrutinize the textual summary and apply the [QA/QC criteria](qaqc-criteria-preprocessed.md#textual-summary).
    - [ ] Visualize the T2* map mosaic, and apply the [QA/QC criteria](qaqc-criteria-preprocessed.md#t2-map).
    - [ ] Check the T2* gray-matter intensity histogram, and apply the [QA/QC criteria](qaqc-criteria-preprocessed.md#t2-gray-matter-values).
    - [ ] Visualize the co-registration flickering mosaic, apply the [QA/QC criteria](qaqc-criteria-preprocessed.md#alignment-of-functional-and-anatomical-mri-data).
        Flickering between T1w and BOLD images is active while hovering your mouse on the mosaic area.
    - [ ] Skip the next reportlets and go to the BHT section

#### BHT
!!! note "Following the same reasoning as described in QCT, we are in principle not excluding BHT scans."

- [ ] Go through the report section of the BHT
    - [ ] Scrutinize the textual summary and apply the [QA/QC criteria](qaqc-criteria-preprocessed.md#textual-summary).
    - [ ] Visualize the T2* map mosaic, and apply the [QA/QC criteria](qaqc-criteria-preprocessed.md#t2-map).
    - [ ] Check the T2* gray-matter intensity histogram, and apply the [QA/QC criteria](qaqc-criteria-preprocessed.md#t2-gray-matter-values).
    - [ ] Visualize the co-registration flickering mosaic, apply the [QA/QC criteria](qaqc-criteria-preprocessed.md#alignment-of-functional-and-anatomical-mri-data).
        Flickering between T1w and BOLD images is active while hovering your mouse on the mosaic area.
    - [ ] Skip the next reportlets and go to the RSfMRI section

#### RSfMRI
- [ ] Go through the report section of the RSfMRI
- [ ] Scrutinize the textual summary and apply the [QA/QC criteria](qaqc-criteria-preprocessed.md#textual-summary).
- [ ] Visualize the T2* map mosaic, and apply the [QA/QC criteria](qaqc-criteria-preprocessed.md#t2-map).
- [ ] Check the T2* gray-matter intensity histogram, and apply the [QA/QC criteria](qaqc-criteria-preprocessed.md#t2-gray-matter-values).
- [ ] Visualize the co-registration flickering mosaic, apply the [QA/QC criteria](qaqc-criteria-preprocessed.md#alignment-of-functional-and-anatomical-mri-data).
    Flickering between T1w and BOLD images is active while hovering your mouse on the mosaic area.
- [ ] Visualize the next mosaic displaying regions of interest (ROIs) used to estimate the nuisance regressors, and apply the [QA/QC criteria](qaqc-criteria-preprocessed.md#brain-mask-and-anatomicaltemporal-compcor-rois).
- [ ] Visualize the carpet plot and nuisance signals panel, and apply the [QA/QC criteria](qaqc-criteria-preprocessed.md#bold-summary).
- [ ] Visualize the confound correlation heatmap and use it to [choose the regressors](qaqc-criteria-preprocessed.md#correlations-between-nuisance-regressors) 
    you will include in the nuisance regression model.

- [ ] Finally, verify that no errors are reported within the "Errors" section. If there are, proceed as indicated in ["Not all *fMRIPrep* derivatives were generated"](#executing-fmriprep).

!!! warning "Immediately report errors or quality issues encountered"
    If errors or quality issues are encountered, find the issue corresponding to that session in [the dataset's repository](https://github.com/{{ secrets.data.gh_repo | default('<organization>/<repo_name>') }}/issues) and report a comprehensive description of the problems.
    In case of *fMRIPrep* failure, follow the procedure described above in "Not all *fMRIPrep* derivatives were generated".
