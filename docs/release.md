# Defacing
The first step before releasing the data is to deface the T1w and T2w images for all sessions.
To perform defacing, we are using a software called PyDeface (Gulban et al. 2019).
To proceed, run the following command in the command line:
```bash
    bash ./code/defacing/run_pydeface.sh
```
