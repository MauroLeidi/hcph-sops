### Task for pilot sessions

-[ ] Establish the participant's normal frequency to pace the baseline breathing block in the breath holding task.
-[ ] Optimize the angular resolution and the number of seeds in the tractography to maximize the average repeatability of dMRI-derived scalars.
-[ ] Determine the voxel size of dMRI (1.6x1.6x1.6 [mm<sup>3</sup>] or 2.0x2.0x2.0 [mm<sup>3</sup>]) based on reaching the signal-to-noise ratio of 20 dB in white matter voxels
