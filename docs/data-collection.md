- [ ] Open psychopy 3 by typing `psychopy`
- [ ] Make sure you have internet access to a Git repository and check the repository fMRI-Control-Task is up-to-date.


#### DAY OF SCAN, prior to participant arrival, set-up of the Eye tracker (ET) EyeLink 1000 Plus at 3 Tesla

**Section 1, Eye-tracker Transport, Preparation of the Cable Inside the Scanner room:**
- [ ] The eye-tracker (ET) computer is kept on its designated rolling table, which is stored under the projector in room BH07/075. Behind the rolling table, there is a transparent panel where the ET camera will be set up inside the scanner bore.
- [ ] Verify that the monitor and the cable, as well as the ET over the PC tower are fixed to the chariot with the scotch. 
- [ ]	Bring the table with the ET computer to the access closet (outside) of the scanner room. Be very attentive during the displacement and lift the front wheels when passing steps or cables. The transparent panel can also be brought to the scanning room simultaneously, if done with care.
- [ ] Place the transparent standing panel inside the scanner bore, following the indications stuck on the panel (i.e., it has indication of which side goes up and tape markers for the position of the ET).
- [ ]	From room BH07/071 (first cabinet on the left), take the box with the «fMRI usage» label, containing the ET camera, lenses, and the special infrared mirror. 
- [ ]	Open the door of the cable section between the recording room and the scanner room.
- [ ]	First pass through the hole the Optic fiber (Orange Cable) and the Charger (Back cable). This operation needs two persons, one outside the scanner, the other inside. Both persons need to lift the cable to avoid its abrasion with the borders of the metallic cylinder, which is the passage between exterior and interior of the scanner room. Once the sliding of the cable is finished, leave the extremities inside the scanner room in the left-top corner, far from the scanner. These parts are magnetic.
- [ ]	Place the plastic base into the hole of the MR, top side. DON’T PUSH IT inside, it needs to be adjusted once the subject is placed inside the scanner, to insure a standardize position of the ET.
- [ ] Remove the head coil that is currently installed. If it is the 64-channel, you can just temporarily move it into the scanner's bore. Otherwise, store it on the shelve where the other coils are.
- [ ] Remove the spine coil by lifting the corresponding lock and replace it with the back paddings.
- [ ]	Take the 64-channel head and neck coil, remove the parts in the head end of the bed to allow the coil to fit inside.
- [ ]	Detach the mirror frame from the head coil, if it is placed there. Remove unnecessary items from the scanning bed, and prepare the mirror to attach the infrared mirror of the ET at a later step.
- [ ] Prepare two long stripes of scotch tape and leave them in a convenient place to then attach the ET mirror with them on to the standard mirror. E.g., attach the corner of each strip to the back part of the mirror frame.
- [ ]	Take out the box containing the infrared mirror from the «fMRI usage» box. **<span style="color:red">DO NOT EXTRACT THE MIRROR OUT FROM ITS BOX YET</span>**. The mirror's box is labeled as [*RELIQUIA DI SAN GENNARO*](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Gennaro#La_reliquia) to emphasize that **THIS IS THE MOST DELICATE PART, BECAUSE THE MIRROR CANNOT BE REPLACED <span style="color:red">NOR CLEANED</span>**. This mirror is **EXTREMELY EXPENSIVE**. 
 
![infrared-mirror](./assets/ETimages/infrared-mirror.png)

- [ ]	Get two gloves (e.g., from the box hanging at the entrance of the scanner room), then approach the scanner bed. Put the gloves on, and **DON’T TOUCH ANYTHING**. You MUST have the standard mirror dismounted and in front of you at this point. **WITH THE GLOVES** proceed to extract the infra-red mirror from its box, being extremely careful. **YOU CAN ONLY TOUCH THE MIRROR WITH GLOVES**, because it cannot be cleaned up. Watch out for **FINGERPRINTS** and once taken out of its box, **IMMEDIATELY PROCEED TO ATTACH IT** to the standard coil mirror. The mirror MUST NOT be placed anywhere else if not in its box.
- [ ]	**WITH YOUR GLOVES ON**, attach the ET mirror to the standard coil mirror (the larger mirror that points toward projector's screen at the back of the scanning room). Put it more or less in the center, although <span style="color:red">this position may need to be adjusted</span> (being careful and with the same precautions explained before) and stick it with the paper scotch. **Do not touch the surface of the ET mirror.**
- [ ]	Place the mirror frame back on the head coil. As always, **DO NOT TOUCH THE MIRROR**. 

**Section 2, Preparation of the Eye-tracker, OUTSIDE THE SCANNER ROOM:**

- [ ]	Take out of the lenses box the MR-Compatible lense. It is easy to recognize it, from its two golden screws.

![cover-mri-compatible-lens](./assets/ETimages/cover-mri-compatible-lens.png "Cover MRI compatible lens")
![mri-compatible-lens](./assets/ETimages/mri-compatible-lens.png "MRI compatible lens")

- [ ]	Un-screw any present lenses, being very careful: one hand must be hold under the lens, to avoid crashes, as it is a bit tricky to screw and un-screw it. In case a lens it’s already present, un-screw it and put it back to its plastic bag, inside the lenses box. 

![screw-mri-compatible-lens](./assets/ETimages/screw-lens.png "Screw the MRI compatible lens")

- [ ]	Be Careful: the lens needs to be substituted before entering inside the Scanner Room
- [ ]	Take the ET inside the scanner room, and put it on top of the plastic base. The two back "feet" of Base of the ET have to be within two corners made of transparent scotch and already attached to the plexiglass. **BE CAREFUL, HOLD IT STRONGLY, CAUSE THE MAGNETIC FIELD GENERATES RESISTANCES.** Connect the cables (two plugs for the black, one plug for the orange).

**Section 3, TMS-Laptop and PC-tower preparation and Projector, OUTSIDE THE SCANNER ROOM:**

- [ ]	Connect the Power cable to the metallic extremity belonging to the PC-tower

![connect-power-cable](./assets/ETimages/connect-power-cable.png "Connect power cable")

- [ ]	Plug in the Power strip containing the ET Power Cable, the PC-tower power, etc

![powerstrip](./assets/ETimages/powerstrip.png)
![plug-powerstrip](./assets/ETimages/plug-powerstrip.png)

- [ ]	Switch on the PC-tower, as well as the laptop:

![pctower](./assets/ETimages/pctower.png)

- [ ]	This is the sync box of the scanner, allowing a synchronization of the triggers between the scanner sequence and the ET recordings.

![syncbox](./assets/ETimages/syncbox.png)

- [ ]	Connect to the laptop the ET- ethernet blue cable and the USB sync box. If it’s plugged into the sync box, it needs to be re-plugged in after usage.

![connect-ethernet-to-laptop](./assets/ETimages/connect-ethernet-to-laptop.png)
![ubs-syncbox](./assets/ETimages/ubs-syncbox.png)

- [ ]	Connect the **hos68752** laptop to the screen switch box (see picture below) with the corresponding HDMI cable. This should project your screen on the second screen.

[ADD IMAGE OF SWITCH BOX HDMI CABLE]

- [ ]	Now it’s time to check that the sync box correctly send the triggers (Corresponding to push the key-button “S, s “ from keyboard. Open a .txt file generator on the laptop, take the Sync box and go on “Simulation”. You should see that the sync box is writing “S” onto your notepad.

![choose-simulation-syncbox](./assets/ETimages/choose-simulation-syncbox.png)
![simulation-syncbox](./assets/ETimages/simulation-syncbox.png)
![sss-texteditor](./assets/ETimages/sss-texteditor.png)

- [ ]	Once the previous has been checked, it’s time to put the sync box in “Synchronization” mode. Start the session: the box it’s ready to receive the trigger from the sequence and they will be available for Experiment builder / Python / whatever is used to register the trigger and the ET signal.

![choose-synchronisation-syncbox](./assets/ETimages/choose-synchronisation-syncbox.png)
![start-session-syncbox](./assets/ETimages/start-session-syncbox.png)
![run-session-syncbox](./assets/ETimages/run-session-syncbox.png)

- [ ]	Switch the projector on by hitting the power button on on its right side. The projector is found in room BH07/075. If the projection is not well located, the projector needs to be adjusted. E.g., change the height of the paper pile that supports it (see images, FENS papers).

![projector](./assets/ETimages/projector.png)
*The hole is the part through which we should check the quality of the projection*

![paper-projector](./assets/ETimages/paper-projector.png)
![adjust-projector](./assets/ETimages/adjust-projector.png)

- [ ] Go back to the hos68752 laptop, open a terminal and execute `conda deactivate`.

- [x] Have participant empty their pockets or change into scrubs, and remove all jewelry/hair accessories and check for any missed metallic objects with the scan center’s preferred method
- [x] Instruct participant on staying still and encourage them to request breaks if necessary
- [x] Describe the participant how the session will develop, with special attention to tasks. Answer all the questions that may arise.
- [x] Show the alarm button to the participant, instruct them to hold it on their hand throughout the session, with the exception of the finger tapping task for which they should leave it on their belly
- [x] Place participant on the scanner's bed:
  - [x] Accommodate the head inside the head coil
  - [x] Check again that it is the 64-channel head coil
  - [x] Check the scanner's screen that the three coils [SAY MORE SPECIFIC] are connected and active
  - [x] Solicit feedback on participant’s comfort while positioning them on the scanner bed and suggest ergonomic positioning of arms to avoid discomfort
  - [x] Make sure the speaker is audible (and not annoying) and confirm the participant's feedback

#### DAY OF SCAN, participant setup

- [ ]	Take the half-circle one-direction screen from the table behind the scanner and put it on the back of the scanner, behind the ET system (don't push the plexiglas yet)
- [ ]	Memorize where the other tools for the recordings are, to put those back in place at the end (coil, emergency button, ears cover.) 
- [ ]	Bring the participant inside the room, and give him the ear-plugs to protect the hearing during acquisition.
- [ ]	Give to the participant the emergency button. Make the participant try it, so they can see it works. To switch off the alarm, there’s a button on the scanner (circular, both on the left and on the right of the hole) 
- [ ]	Adjust the participant inside. With the pillow, its head position needs to be adjusted and elevated until the head can’t move anymore and the nose and the front of the participants are both adherent to the upper coil. This procedure guarantees that the ET "sees" the eyes. If not, the experiment gets stuck.
- [ ]	This part needs to be repeated taking out and putting back the upper part of the head-coil, adjusting the pillow at every step, until the head is fixed and the nose and front of the participant touch the coil. In case of need, ask the participant to "say yes" with the head (chin on neck) and keep this position, place the pillows, place the coil and check that the participants' front touches the coil. Now the nose can also be a bit far from the coil. Tell the participant to relax the neck, so the nose should go a bit up and touch the coil.  
- [ ]	Take the Ears -protection pillow, stick it on top of the ears of the participant, one by one. Once they are settled, you can pump it, until the participant is comfortable, the head is fixed and the ears are protected.
- [ ]	Once the previous part is insured, the participant is ready. If he’s cold, put a blanket on top of him. Give to the participant the emergency button. 
- [ ]	Gently move the participant with the manual regulation. Stop when the head is under the head-localizer. Ask the participant to close it’s eyes, localize the head with the infrareds.
- [ ]	Switch off the infrareds, now the participant can open the eyes. You can move the participant (always gently as before) inside the scanner, until the mm counter marks “Isometric”.
- [ ]	Go behind the scanner, push the plastic base until it touches the bed. Hold on the Eye-Tracker.
- [ ]	Regulate the Eye-tracker position until you see from the projector screen the Eye. In case of need, you can adjust the strength of the infrared light (emitter). This is the black box on the other side with respect to the lens. Under the emitter there are two little screws. Unscrew, move the emitter front/back, check the contrast of the face image, re-screw. Once the eye is well seen, the image is zoomed (externally by the operator in front of the PC-tower) to the pupil. The right lens needs to be manipulated rotating the roller, like what you would do with your reflex to obtain the focus. If the position of the Eye-tracker is not satisfying, you can move the base. 

![base-eye-tracker](./assets/ETimages/base-eye-tracker.png)

- [ ]	If the pupil is correctly seen, as well as the eye, you can go out. The calibration needs to start. 
- [ ]	Tell the participant that he will need to follow some point with its eyes, without moving his head.
- [ ]	Tell the participant to move the eyes ONLY after the point moves (do not anticipate).
- [ ]	The ET software needs to show a cross performed during the calibration. If not, the ET inside the scanner needs to be adjusted.
- [ ]	If not, the head of the participant needs to be adjusted again.
- [ ]	If not, the mirror needs to be moved up or down (being careful as mentioned before). Just a few mm can ruin the calibration and the eye-position.
- [ ]	<span style="color:red"> If the calibration is ok, you can move forward and record. text</span>
