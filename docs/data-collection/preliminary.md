## Overall experimental setting

The goal of the experimental setting is to obtain several functional MRI tasks and a long diffusion MRI scan with synchronized physiological recordings, including gas contents with a gas analyzer (GA), eye tracking (ET; including the right eye position, pupil size, blinks, etc.), respiration tracking through a pneumatic respiration belt (RB), and finally MRI-compatible electrocardiogram (ECG).

The overall experimental setting can be sumarized as follows:

```

The above graph can be broken down as follows:

1. **Signals generating from the Scanning Room**.
    In addition to the MR imagery produced by the scanner, the participant will be wearing the RB, the ECG leads, a nasal cannula to retrieve the expired gases, and finally their right eye will be recorded with the infrared camera of the ET.
    All those probes and devices carry signals outside the Scanning Room either through cables or tubes, with the access panel as the interface.
    The access panel also has a connector carrying the **trigger** signals generated by MR schemes, which indicate important events in the MRI acquisition (typically, one trigger pulse is generated for each new *repetition time* —TR—, e.g., with every fMRI volume).
1. **Syncbox**.
    A *NordicLabs Syncbox* receives TTL (transistor-transistor logic) triggers from the scanner.
    This box can just forward the triggers converted into other formats and/or manipulate them (e.g., filter, generate, etc.).
1. **Gas analyzer (GA)**.
    The GA is a device that continuously measures the amount of two gases (CO<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub>) from a sample fed at the front of the device with a connected tube (this tube comes from inside of the Scanning Room and ends in the nasal cannula the participant is wearing, as shown in the graph).
1. **BIOPAC**.
    The BIOPAC is the main recording hub.
    It directly receives analogical signals from the Scanning Room (for the case of the RB and the ECG).
    Indirectly, it receives the analogical signal from the GA, and digital signals from the *Psychopy laptop* ({{ secrets.hosts.psychopy | default("███") }}).

1. **Eye tracker (ET)**.
    The ET is composed of two main elements:
    (i) inside the scanner's bore, we place an arm that holds an infrared lens and camera sensor on one side and an infrared lamp that illuminates the right eye of the subject through a special mirror to reflect the infrared spectrum; and (ii) a PC tower that receives the camera recordings, postprocess the images and calculates the final parameters of interest (position of the eye, pupil size, etc.).
    The ET is also connected to the *Psychopy laptop* ({{ secrets.hosts.psychopy | default("███") }}), and communicates bi-directionally with it (e.g., to record logs or receive "messages" such as triggers or task events).
    The ET **is NOT connected to the BIOPAC**, with the implication that the ET data is not stored with the other physiological information.
1. **Stimuli presentation laptop**.
    The *Psychopy laptop* ({{ secrets.hosts.psychopy | default("███") }}) has the *Psychopy* software install and with it, the task programs are executed.
    This experiment consists of three tasks: breath-holding task (*BHT*), resting-state fMRI (*rest*), and a positive-control task (*PCT*).
    This laptop also stores the data recorded by the ET at the end of the experiment.
1. **Physiology recording laptop**.
    The *AcqKnowledge laptop* ({{ secrets.hosts.acqknowledge | default("███") }}) runs the BIOPAC's *AcqKnowledge* software and with it, this computer records the signals and allows visualization of the data coming from the BIOPAC.
    All the inputs to the BIOPAC are multiplexed through into an Ethernet cable that is connected to this laptop.

## Once, at the beginning of the project

### Setting up the scanner protocol at the MR console

!!! warning "Emergency procedures"

    It is critical you fully understand and study the [emergency procedures to run an MRI scan at CHUV](./emergency-procedures.md).

!!! important "Follow Reproin conventions"

    When assigning names to the MR sequences in the protocol, make sure to follow the [Reproin conventions](https://dbic-handbook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/mri/reproin.html) to maximally facilitate the conversion into BIDS.


Once the protocol is decided upon, and after any updates, make sure of storing the protocol.

!!! warning "Login as an advanced user to save protocol"
    As a good practice, always work as the standard user `{{ secrets.login.username_scanner | default("janedoe") }}`.
    Change for *advanced user mode* if you want to save the protocol.

    - [ ] Simultaneously press the <span class="keypress">Tab</span> + <span class="keypress">Delete</span> + <span class="keypress">:octicons-sign-out-16:</span> on the control-computer's keyboard:

        > Username: `{{ secrets.login.superusername_scanner | default("superjanedoe") }}`
        >
        > Password: `{{ secrets.login.superuserpass_scanner | default("******") }}`

    !!! Danger "After three wrong password entries, access will be denied, and only a Siemens engineer will be able to unlock the MR scanner."

- [ ] Update the *Number of measurements* in all `func-bold_task-*` sequences, according to the [previously recorded timings](#task-timing):

    $$N_\text{measurements} = L_t / \text{TR}, \quad t \in \{\text{bht}, \text{pct}, \text{rest}\},$$

    where $L_t$ is the length of a particular task $t$ (either BHT, PCT, or resting state) in seconds as timed before, and
    $\text{TR}$ is the **repetition time** of the BOLD sequence, in seconds.

- [ ] Now that you are logged in as an advanced user, save your protocol:
    - [ ] Open the Dot-Cockpit window
        ![](../assets/images/save_protocol1.jpg)
    - [ ] In `Browse`, find the right folder to save the protocol in (*RESEARCH* ⤷ *Oscar*).
    - [ ] Right click on the folder and select *New* ⤷ *Program*. This opens an empty page in the program editor
        ![](../assets/images/save_protocol2.jpg)
        ![](../assets/images/save_protocol3.jpg)
    - [ ] Select all the sequences you want to run from the sequence list and click right to copy.
        ![](../assets/images/save_protocol4.jpg)
    - [ ] Drag or paste the copied sequences in the program editor.
        ![](../assets/images/save_protocol5.jpg)
    - [ ] Once finished, click on the floppy disk icon (:fontawesome-solid-floppy-disk:) in the upper left to save.
    - [ ] Give the protocol a relevant name starting with the date of acquisition in the format YYYYMMDD and click <span class="consolebutton">Save</span>.
        ![](../assets/images/save_protocol6.jpg)
    - [ ] If desired, the protocol details can also be downloaded as a pdf on a peripherical USB key.
        - [ ] Right-click on the protocol and select *Print*
        - [ ] Save the PDF in your USB key.
- [ ] Make sure you save a different protocol for each of the four PE directions (i.e., AP, PA, LR, RL).

    ```

#### Setting up a synchronization service

!!! important "It's fundamental to have a reliable means of communication with the BIOPAC digital inputs"

    The following guidelines set up a little service on a linux box that keeps listening for key presses (mainly, the <span class="keypress">s</span> trigger from the trigger box), and RPC (remote procedure calls) from typically *Psychopy* or similar software.

    The service is spun up automatically when you connect the MMBT-S modem interface that communicates with the BIOPAC (that is, the *N-shaped pink box*)

- [ ] Copy the [latest version of the code to send triggers](https://github.com/TheAxonLab/hcph-sops/blob/mkdocs/code/synchronization/forward-trigger-service.py)
- [ ] To automatically start the program when the BIOPAC is connected, create a udev rule as follows:
    ```
    sudo nano /etc/udev/rules.d/99-forward-trigger.rules
    ```
- [ ] Add the following rule to the file:
    ```
    ACTION=="add", KERNEL=="ttyACM0", SUBSYSTEM=="tty", TAG+="systemd", ENV{SYSTEMD_WANTS}="forward-trigger.service"
    ```
- [ ] Save the file and exit the editor.
- [ ] Run the following command to reload the udev rules:
    ```
    sudo udevadm control --reload-rules
    ```
- [ ] Create a systemd service unit file:
    ```
    sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/forward-trigger.service
    ```
- [ ] Add the following content to the file (Adapt the path to forward-trigger.py to the location on your computer):
    ```
    [Unit]
    Description=Forward Trigger Service
    After=network.target

    [Service]
    ExecStart=/usr/bin/python3 /path/to/forward-trigger.py
    WorkingDirectory=/path/to/forward-trigger/directory
    StandardOutput=null

    [Install]
    WantedBy=multi-user.target
    ```
- [ ] Save the file and exit the text editor.
- [ ] Run the following command to enable the service to start at boot:
    ```
    sudo systemctl enable forward-trigger
    ```
- [ ] Run the following command to reload the systemd daemon:
    ```
    sudo systemctl daemon-reload
    ```

??? important "Testing the service without the syncbox connected"

      - [ ] Ensure `socat` and `screen` are installed (if not already):
          ```
          sudo apt-get update
          sudo apt-get install socat screen
          ```
      - [ ] Create a virtual serial port and establish a symbolic link to `/dev/ttyACM0` using the following command:
          ```
          sudo socat PTY,link=/tmp/virtual_serial_port PTY,link=/dev/ttyACM0,group-late=dialout,mode=666,b9600
          ```
      - [ ] With `screen`, listen to the new virtual serial port:
          ```
          screen /dev/ttyACM0
          ```
      - [ ] Press <span class="keypress">s</span> and verify that `^A` appears in the screen terminal.

## Every two months

### Calibrate the GA

??? important "A gas mixture bottle with a known CO<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub> concentrations is necessary"

    CO<sub>2</sub> concentration must be between 5% and 10%, while O<sub>2</sub> within 5% and 21%.
    A second reference mixture is necessary, and room air can be used, knowing that atmospheric contents by volume are 0.039 ±0.001%
    for CO<sub>2</sub> and 20.946 ±0.003% for O<sub>2</sub>.

- [ ] Connect the GA to the BIOPAC as described above.
- [ ] Connect the BIOPAC to the *Physiology recording laptop* ({{ secrets.hosts.acqknowledge | default("███") }}) as described above.
- [ ] Connect the *AcqKnowledge* License Key into a USB Port of the *Physiology recording laptop* ({{ secrets.hosts.acqknowledge | default("███") }}).
- [ ] Open *AcqKnowledge* software on the *Physiology recording laptop* ({{ secrets.hosts.acqknowledge | default("███") }}).
- [ ] Open the template *graph file* ([`EXP_BASE.gtl`](../assets/files/EXP_BASE.gtl))
- [ ] Edit the configuration of the inputs 3 (connected to the CO<sub>2</sub> output of the GA) and 4 (connected to the O<sub>2</sub> output of the GA).
    Lower and upper calibration points can be set by sampling the input a number of times with the *AcqKnowledge* utility.
- [ ] Overwrite the template *graph file* `EXP_BASE.gtl`.
