### Preparing the *stimuli presentation laptop* ({{ secrets.hosts.psychopy | default("███") }})

The stimuli presentation laptop and any other box you want to use for debugging and development will require a few additional software packages to be available.

#### Installing *EyeLink* (eye tracker software)

!!! warning "The *EyeLink* software MUST be installed BEFORE *Pychopy*"

- [ ] Log on *{{ secrets.hosts.psychopy | default("███") }}* with the username *{{ secrets.login.username_psychopy | default("███") }}* and password `{{ secrets.login.password_psychopy | default("*****") }}`.

- [ ] Enable Canonical's universe repository with the following command:
    ``` shell
    sudo add-apt-repository universe
    sudo apt update
    ```
- [ ] Install and update the ca-certificates package:
    ``` shell
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install ca-certificates
    ```
- [ ] Add the SR Research Software Repository signing key:
    ``` shell
    curl -sS https://apt.sr-research.com/SRResearch_key | gpg --dearmor | sudo tee /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/sr-research.gpg
    ```
- [ ] Add the SR Research Software Repository as an *Aptitude* source:
    ``` shell
    sudo add-apt-repository 'deb [arch=amd64] https://apt.sr-research.com SRResearch main'
    ```
- [ ] Install the EyeLink Developers Kit:
    ``` shell
    sudo apt install eyelink-display-software
    ```
- [ ] Install the EyeLink Data Viewer:
    ``` shell
    sudo apt install eyelink-dataviewer
    ```

#### Installing our synchronization server

During the session, we run a synchronization server that acts as a hub for the signals (triggers, task events, etc.) that define the experiment.
For the best experience, we *daemonize* the synchronization service (meaning, we make it a service of the operative system that runs in the background).
To install it as a service, please follow [the documentation in the appendix](notes-software.md#setting-up-the-synchronization-service-as-a-daemon-in-the-background)

- [ ] Locate the latest version of the synchronization service on your system.
    It is within the SOPs repository, at ``{{ secrets.data.sops_clone_path | default('<path>') }}/code/synchronization/forward-trigger-service.py``.
- [ ] Install the necessary libraries <mark>as root</mark>:
    ``` shell
    sudo python3 -m pip install -r {{ secrets.data.sops_clone_path | default('<path>') }}/code/synchronization/requirements.txt
    ```
- [ ] Test the service is properly installed:
    ``` shell
    sudo python3 code/synchronization/forward-trigger-service.py --disable-mmbt-check
    ```

    !!! important "Use the `--disable-mmbt-check` flag only if you do not plan to connect the MMBT-S trigger box"

- [ ] Test operation with our test client:

    !!! tip "Check the server's log file at `/var/log/forward-trigger-service.log`"

    Open a separate terminal on a separate window
    Then, open and follow the log file:
    ``` shell
    less +F /var/log/forward-trigger-service.log
    ```

    Return to the original terminal, keeping the other window visible and execute:
    ``` shell
    python code/synchronization/forward-trigger-client.py
    ```

    The log file should now have added two lines like:
    ```
    2023-10-12 14:44:31.788 - INFO - Data received: <b'\x02'>
    2023-10-12 14:44:31.788 - INFO - Forwarded <b'\x02'>
    ```

??? important "Testing the service without the MMBT-S connected"

    Testing the service without the MMBT-S trigger box connected requires emmulating `/dev/ttyACM0`:

      - [ ] Ensure `socat` and `screen` are installed (if not already):
          ``` shell
          sudo apt-get update
          sudo apt-get install socat screen
          ```
      - [ ] Create a virtual serial port and establish a symbolic link to `/dev/ttyACM0` using the following command:
          ``` shell
          sudo socat PTY,link=/tmp/virtual_serial_port PTY,link=/dev/ttyACM0,group-late=dialout,mode=666,b9600
          ```
      - [ ] With `screen`, listen to the new virtual serial port:
          ``` shell
          screen /dev/ttyACM0
          ```

          !!! tip "Alternatively, you can check the server's log file at `/var/log/forward-trigger-service.log`"

      - [ ] Press <span class="keypress">s</span> and verify that `^A` appears in the screen terminal.

#### Prepare the *Psychopy* experiments

!!! tip "The appendix has some guides on [how to install *Psychopy*](notes-software.md#psychopy-installation)."

- [ ] Log on *{{ secrets.hosts.psychopy | default("███") }}* with the username *{{ secrets.login.username_psychopy| default("███") }}* and password `{{ secrets.login.password_psychopy| default("*****") }}`.

??? important "Make sure to load the correct environment"

    - [ ] Deactivate conda (if active):
        ``` shell
        conda deactivate
        ```
    - [ ] Load the new virtual environment:
        ``` shell
        source $HOME/psychopyenv/bin/activate
        ```

- [ ] [Fork the HCPh-fMRI-tasks repository](https://github.com/TheAxonLab/HCPh-fMRI-tasks/fork) under your user on GitHub.
- [ ] Clone the [HCPh-fMRI-tasks repository](https://github.com/TheAxonLab/HCPh-fMRI-tasks):
    ```
    git clone git@github.com:<your-gh-username>/HCPh-fMRI-tasks.git
    ```
- [ ] Set-up the original repository as upstream remote:
    ```
    git remote add upstream git@github.com:theaxonlab/HCPh-fMRI-tasks.git
    ```
- [ ] Open *Psychopy* and (optionally) a experiment file corresponding to a task by typing the following command in the terminal:
    ```
    psychopy --no-splash -b {{ settings.psychopy.tasks.func_qct }}.psyexp
    ```
- [ ] For each task, check the following:
    - [ ] `{{ settings.psychopy.tasks.func_qct }}.psyexp` (quality-control task, QCT):
        - [ ] time it to [confirm the length](intro.md#task-timing), and
        - [ ] check the task runs properly.
    - [ ] `{{ settings.psychopy.tasks.func_rest }}.psyexp` (resting-state fMRI):
        - [ ] time it to confirm the length, and
        - [ ] check that the movie is played.
    - [ ] `{{ settings.psychopy.tasks.func_bht }}.psyexp` (breath-holding task, BHT):
        - [ ] time it to confirm the length, and
        - [ ] check the task runs properly.
    - [ ] `{{ settings.psychopy.tasks.dwi }}.psyexp` (fixation point during DWI):
        - [ ] time it to confirm the length, and
        - [ ] check the task runs properly.

- [ ] Check that *Dropbox* is operative.
- [ ] Create a softlink under the tasks repository to directly store outputs into *Dropbox*:

    ``` bash
    ln -s {{ secrets.psychopy_paths.dropbox }} {{ secrets.psychopy_paths.tasks }}/data
    ```

    ??? danger "For the 'reliability sample' this link was created differently."

        As a result, a manual copy step was necessary to synchronize the data (see [tear-down](tear-down.md#synchronize-collected-physiological-data-eye-tracking-and-biopac-signals))

### Prepare data management (intake and backup) with {{ secrets.hosts.oesteban | default("███") }}

We employ *{{ secrets.hosts.oesteban | default("███") }}* as the server to automatically upload data to the backup repository (*{{ secrets.data.curnagl_backup | default("\<user>@\<host>:\<path>") }}*).
For the physiological recordings (acquired on *{{ secrets.hosts.acqknowledge | default("███") }}* for BIOPAC-registered signals, and on *{{ secrets.hosts.psychopy | default("███") }}* for the eye-tracking), data is synchronized into *{{ secrets.hosts.oesteban | default("███") }}* via *Dropbox*.

- [ ] Create a softlink pointing to the BIOPAC data:

    ``` bash
    ln -s {{ secrets.oesteban_paths.biopac_dbox }} {{ settings.paths.pilot_sourcedata }}/recordings/BIOPAC
    ```

- [ ] Create a softlink pointing to the eye-tracking data:

    ``` bash
    ln -s {{ secrets.oesteban_paths.et_dbox }} {{ settings.paths.pilot_sourcedata }}/recordings/psychopy
    ```

- [ ] Setup a cron job to execute automatically the synchronization:

    ``` cron
    crontab -e
    [ within your file editor add the following line ]
    0 2 * * * rsync -avurP {{ settings.paths.pilot_sourcedata }}* {{ secrets.data.curnagl_backup | default("<user>@<host>:<path>") }}/sourcedata-pilot &> $HOME/var/log/data-curnagl.log
    ```

## Calibration of the GA

The *AcqKnowledge* software must be re-calibrated every two months, approximately.

??? important "A gas mixture bottle with a known CO<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub> concentrations is necessary"

    CO<sub>2</sub> concentration must be between 5% and 10%, while O<sub>2</sub> within 5% and 21%.
    A second reference mixture is necessary, and room air can be used, knowing that atmospheric contents by volume are 0.039 ±0.001%
    for CO<sub>2</sub> and 20.946 ±0.003% for O<sub>2</sub>.

- [ ] Connect the BIOPAC to the *Physiology recording laptop* ({{ secrets.hosts.acqknowledge | default("███") }}) as described in [this section](pre-session.md#setting-up-the-biopac-system-and-physiological-recording-sensors).
- [ ] Connect the *AcqKnowledge* License Key into a USB Port of the *Physiology recording laptop* ({{ secrets.hosts.acqknowledge | default("███") }}).
- [ ] Open *AcqKnowledge* software on the *Physiology recording laptop* ({{ secrets.hosts.acqknowledge | default("███") }}).
- [ ] Open the template *graph file* ([`EXP_BASE.gtl`](../assets/files/EXP_BASE.gtl))
- [ ] Edit the configuration of the inputs 3 (connected to the CO<sub>2</sub> output of the GA) and 4 (connected to the O<sub>2</sub> output of the GA).
    Lower and upper calibration points can be set by sampling the input a number of times with the *AcqKnowledge* utility.
- [ ] Overwrite the template *graph file* `EXP_BASE.gtl`.
